# Quantum Metaphysics

This document summarizes my views on the metaphysics of quantum physics. It begins from an Aristotelian framework and treats quantum theory as a metaphysical account of potentiality becoming actuality.

## 1. Aristotelian frame: potency and actuality

- **Potency** is the mode of being of what can be, not yet what is. It is real but indeterminate.
- **Actuality** is the mode of being of what is, determinate and concrete.

On this view, quantum physics primarily describes **potencies**, while classical physics describes **actualities**. The metaphysical task is to explain how potency becomes actuality without reducing one to the other.

## 2. Two domains: quantum and classical

I divide reality into two domains:

- **Quantum world**: the domain of potentiality. It is not composed of particles in the classical sense.
- **Classical world**: the domain of actuality. It is composed of particles with definite locations and properties.

These two domains are not separate universes but different modes of being. The classical world is the quantum world **under restriction**. A restriction removes or restrains potential; when sufficient constraints are applied to quantum potentiality, actuality appears.

## 2.1 Quantum rules within the classical world

Large and small things in the classical world can be viewed as obeying quantum rules **until** they collapse into the real, i.e., until the constraint of being actual is placed on them. Actuality is not assumed from the start; it is imposed by restriction.

## 2.2 Potentiality, extension, and time

The quantum world differs from the classical world in a key way: **actuality** is constrained to a determinate **time, space, and extension**, while **potentiality** is not so constrained. Actual things are bounded by *where* and *when* they are. Potential things are not yet fixed in this way.

As a result, entities in the quantum world can be described as encountering time more as a **constant now** rather than a sequence of past, present, and future. A **flat view of time** does **not** mean retrocausality; it means there is only *now*. All potential within the volume is present, along with probabilities for each potential, and constraints remove some of those potentials. This is simply taking **potentiality** seriously: it applies to time as well. Every expanding volume of potential **carries its history**, and that history is not a separate past but the volume of potential itself.

## 2.3 Time as potential (novelty)

Time itself can be treated as an **aspect of potential**. There is no privileged past‑present‑future until actuality is imposed. Ordinary temporal order is an **actualization** of potential time. Asking for a “past” in the quantum domain is like **dividing by zero**: it demands a structure (ordered time) that has not yet been actualized.

## 2.4 Light vs. heavy restriction

- A **light restriction** removes some potential shapes of the volume across time; it narrows what could happen without making anything actual.
- A **heavy restriction** is the restriction that **makes it real**: it collapses the wavefunction and imposes actuality. It marks the shift from **volume of potential** to **point of actual reality**.

## 2.5 What applies restrictions

Restrictions are applied by **volumes of potential interacting with other volumes of potential**. These interactions multiply potentials but also restrict them. Example: light bouncing off a wall is a volume of light potential interacting with a dense collection of electron potential volumes. The interaction constrains what the light volume can be and do, shaping (or, under heavy restriction, collapsing) its potentiality.


## 3. What the wavefunction represents

The wavefunction is not a particle. It is a **structure of potentiality**:

- It is a **volume of space** with an extended, often complex shape.
- Its shape is best described as a **density of probability**, not a collection of tiny objects.
- It represents **where and how** a potential actuality could be realized.

In short: the wavefunction is an extended field of potency. By **volume of potential** I simply mean the **wavefunction in 3D space**, as described by standard quantum physics mathematics.

For many-body cases, this means **many volumes of potential interacting** with one another.

## 3.1 Fields as tools, not ontology

I do not take **fields** to be ontological. They are mathematical tools: an infinite grid of points with values updating from point to point. By contrast, the quantum volume of potentiality is a **real thing moving through space**, not merely numbers updating on a grid.

## 3.2 Intuition: faucet stream of potential

An intuitive picture is a **faucet streaming potential**. The faucet is the source, and what pours out is a continuous stream of potential that spreads through space. In the double-slit case, the stream hits the slits and **fans out**, overlapping with itself like ripples in water. The interference pattern is the shape of that stream before any collapse. This makes it easier to visualize why the experiment shows waves even though no particles are present until collapse.

## 4. No particles in the quantum world

In the quantum domain, there are no particles as actual objects. There are only **entities of potential**. These are not localized points, but extended probability structures occupying volumes of space.

The classical idea of a particle is the end state of a process, not the fundamental starting point.

## 5. Collapse as the transition from potency to actuality

The transition from the quantum to the classical is the **wavefunction collapse**. Metaphysically, collapse is the **actualization** of a potential:

- A diffuse volume of probability **contracts** into a definite outcome.
- The collapse yields a **specific point in space and time**, where a particle becomes actual.

Collapse is therefore not merely an update of knowledge. It is a real change in the mode of being: potency becomes actuality. The heavy restriction that triggers collapse turns an extended volume of potentiality into a **particle situated by probabilities within that volume**. Collapse is a restriction so strong that it removes nearly all competing potentials, forcing a specific reality.

Particle-like detection events are simply this collapse: the **volume of probabilities** turns into a **particular position in time and space**. A volume turns into a point.

## 6. Summary thesis

- The quantum world is the realm of potentiality, described by extended probability densities.
- The classical world is the realm of actuality, described by particles at definite locations.
- The classical world is the quantum world under constraint; some constraints exist within the quantum realm without collapse, but a **heavy restriction** induces collapse.
- Wavefunction collapse is the metaphysical bridge between these two realms, converting potential volumes into actual particles situated by probabilities within those volumes.

This is a realist account of the wavefunction as potential being and of collapse as real actualization.

## 7. The role of human experience (for discussion)

For the sake of discussion, the **real creation item** can be taken to be **human experience**: the point at which actuality is imposed and a specific reality is lived rather than merely possible.

## 8. Example: the double-slit experiment

Consider the double-slit experiment. A lamp emits a **spherical volume of potential light** that expands into space. When it reaches the slits, the potential passes through, and its shape behaves much like water ripples: it spreads, overlaps, and **interferes with itself**, producing peaks and valleys. These peaks and valleys are what show up in the measured pattern.

The key point is metaphysical: at no time do actual particles pass through the slits. What passes through is a **volume of potential**, and the interference pattern reflects how potentiality distributes itself before any collapse into a particle occurs.

## 9. Example: marked-path double slit

Consider a variant of the double-slit experiment where a path through one slit is **colored** (marked), and a second device can **remove the coloring** after the slit. The measured pattern changes depending on whether the coloring is removed, which would not make sense if the system were just ping-pong balls with fixed trajectories.

On my view, this is expected: the volume is a **stream of potential** that includes all potential outcomes in a flat view of time (only *now*, not past/future). Adding color to the field adds **restrictions** on what potentials can be realized in the final collapse by removing some potentials. Removing the color relaxes those restrictions, and the pattern changes accordingly. The experiment reveals how constraints shape potentiality before actuality is imposed.

## 10. Glossary (short)

- **Potential**: a real but indeterminate mode of being; a volume of possible outcomes with probabilities.
- **Actual**: determinate being constrained to a specific time, space, and extension.
- **Restriction**: any constraint that removes or restrains potential without necessarily making it actual.
- **Light restriction**: a constraint that narrows potential shapes across time without collapse.
- **Heavy restriction**: a constraint that makes it real by collapsing the wavefunction into actuality.
- **Collapse**: the transition from potential to actual; a heavy restriction that yields a particle outcome.
- **Flat view of time**: the quantum domain is only *now*; all potentials are present without past/future.

## 11. Collapse and probability (clarification)

When the wavefunction collapses, **only one** value in the volume of potentials is realized, with likelihood set by the **probability density**. It would be incoherent to call the selected value “random” in a lawless sense, because the selection follows a distribution. We can say there is a **picking** of a certain value according to probability density; it has rules and a nature, even if we cannot say more.

## 12. Critiques and open tensions

- **Wavefunction in 3D space**: Standard many-body QM uses configuration space. This view interprets many-body cases as many interacting 3D volumes, which needs explicit reconciliation or a stated departure from configuration-space realism.
- **Fields as tools**: The distinction between “field as mathematical grid” and “volume of potential as real” needs sharper metaphysical grounding, not just a grid metaphor.
- **Flat time vs recorded history**: If the quantum domain is only *now*, the story should explain how classical time-ordering and records arise after collapse.
- **Heavy vs light restriction**: The account would benefit from a qualitative criterion for when interactions become heavy restrictions rather than light ones.
- **Probability vs randomness**: “Not random because it follows a distribution” can be clarified as “not lawless,” since distribution-governed randomness is still randomness for many readers.
- **Actuality and extension**: Detection events are point-like, but classical objects are extended; it may help to say actuality can be extended but determinate, unlike potential volumes.
